// Each prompt is a long static string. Keeping them inline made server.ts

// functions here grow as prompts are moved out of server.ts.
//
// Pattern: each prompt gets its own register() function that takes the
// MCP server instance and calls `server.prompt(...)`. server.ts imports
// and calls them in one block. Adding a new prompt is two changes:
//   1. New register* function here
//   2. One call in server.ts:registerPrompts()

const DESIGN_STRATEGY_TEXT = `When working with Figma designs, follow these best practices:

1. Start with Document Structure:
   - First use get_document_info() to understand the current document
   - Plan your layout hierarchy before creating elements
   - Create a main container frame for each screen/section

2. Naming Conventions:
   - Use descriptive, semantic names for all elements
   - Follow a consistent naming pattern (e.g., "Login Screen", "Logo Container", "Email Input")
   - Group related elements with meaningful names

3. Layout Hierarchy:
   - Create parent frames first, then add child elements
   - For forms/login screens:
     * Start with the main screen container frame
     * Create a logo container at the top
     * Group input fields in their own containers
     * Place action buttons (login, submit) after inputs
     * Add secondary elements (forgot password, signup links) last

4. Input Fields Structure:
   - Create a container frame for each input field
   - Include a label text above or inside the input
   - Group related inputs (e.g., username/password) together

5. Element Creation:
   - Use create_frame() for containers and input fields
   - Use create_text() for labels, buttons text, and links
   - Set appropriate colors and styles:
     * Use fillColor for backgrounds
     * Use strokeColor for borders
     * Set proper fontWeight for different text elements

6. Mofifying existing elements:
  - use set_text_content() to modify text content.

7. Visual Hierarchy:
   - Position elements in logical reading order (top to bottom)
   - Maintain consistent spacing between elements
   - Use appropriate font sizes for different text types:
     * Larger for headings/welcome text
     * Medium for input labels
     * Standard for button text
     * Smaller for helper text/links

8. Best Practices:
   - Verify each creation with get_node_info()
   - Use parentId to maintain proper hierarchy
   - Group related elements together in frames
   - Keep consistent spacing and alignment

Example Login Screen Structure:
- Login Screen (main frame)
  - Logo Container (frame)
    - Logo (image/text)
  - Welcome Text (text)
  - Input Container (frame)
    - Email Input (frame)
      - Email Label (text)
      - Email Field (frame)
    - Password Input (frame)
      - Password Label (text)
      - Password Field (frame)
  - Login Button (frame)
    - Button Text (text)
  - Helper Links (frame)
    - Forgot Password (text)
    - Don't have account (text)`;

              text: `# Intelligent Text Replacement Strategy
  
  ## 1. Analyze Design & Identify Structure
  - Scan text nodes to understand the overall structure of the design
  - Use AI pattern recognition to identify logical groupings:
    * Tables (rows, columns, headers, cells)
    * Lists (items, headers, nested lists)
    * Card groups (similar cards with recurring text fields)
    * Forms (labels, input fields, validation text)
    * Navigation (menu items, breadcrumbs)
  \`\`\`
  scan_text_nodes(nodeId: "node-id")
  get_node_info(nodeId: "node-id")  // optional
  \`\`\`
  
  ## 2. Strategic Chunking for Complex Designs
  - Divide replacement tasks into logical content chunks based on design structure
  - Use one of these chunking strategies that best fits the design:
    * **Structural Chunking**: Table rows/columns, list sections, card groups
    * **Spatial Chunking**: Top-to-bottom, left-to-right in screen areas
    * **Semantic Chunking**: Content related to the same topic or functionality
    * **Component-Based Chunking**: Process similar component instances together
  
  ## 3. Progressive Replacement with Verification
  - Create a safe copy of the node for text replacement
  - Replace text chunk by chunk with continuous progress updates
  - After each chunk is processed:
    * Export that section as a small, manageable image
    * Verify text fits properly and maintain design integrity
    * Fix issues before proceeding to the next chunk
  
  \`\`\`
  // Clone the node to create a safe copy
  clone_node(nodeId: "selected-node-id", x: [new-x], y: [new-y])
  
  // Replace text chunk by chunk
  set_multiple_text_contents(
    nodeId: "parent-node-id", 
    text: [
      { nodeId: "node-id-1", text: "New text 1" },
      // More nodes in this chunk...
    ]
  )
  
  // Verify chunk with small, targeted image exports
  export_node_as_image(nodeId: "chunk-node-id", format: "PNG", scale: 0.5)
  \`\`\`
  
  ## 4. Intelligent Handling for Table Data
  - For tabular content:
    * Process one row or column at a time
    * Maintain alignment and spacing between cells
    * Consider conditional formatting based on cell content
    * Preserve header/data relationships
  
  ## 5. Smart Text Adaptation
  - Adaptively handle text based on container constraints:
    * Auto-detect space constraints and adjust text length
    * Apply line breaks at appropriate linguistic points
    * Maintain text hierarchy and emphasis
    * Consider font scaling for critical content that must fit
  
  ## 6. Progressive Feedback Loop
  - Establish a continuous feedback loop during replacement:
    * Real-time progress updates (0-100%)
    * Small image exports after each chunk for verification
    * Issues identified early and resolved incrementally
    * Quick adjustments applied to subsequent chunks
  
  ## 7. Final Verification & Context-Aware QA
  - After all chunks are processed:
    * Export the entire design at reduced scale for final verification
    * Check for cross-chunk consistency issues
    * Verify proper text flow between different sections
    * Ensure design harmony across the full composition
  
  ## 8. Chunk-Specific Export Scale Guidelines
  - Scale exports appropriately based on chunk size:
    * Small chunks (1-5 elements): scale 1.0
    * Medium chunks (6-20 elements): scale 0.7
    * Large chunks (21-50 elements): scale 0.5
    * Very large chunks (50+ elements): scale 0.3
    * Full design verification: scale 0.2
  
  ## Sample Chunking Strategy for Common Design Types
  
  ### Tables
  - Process by logical rows (5-10 rows per chunk)
  - Alternative: Process by column for columnar analysis
  - Tip: Always include header row in first chunk for reference
  
  ### Card Lists
  - Group 3-5 similar cards per chunk
  - Process entire cards to maintain internal consistency
  - Verify text-to-image ratio within cards after each chunk
  
  ### Forms
  - Group related fields (e.g., "Personal Information", "Payment Details")
  - Process labels and input fields together
  - Ensure validation messages and hints are updated with their fields
  
  ### Navigation & Menus
  - Process hierarchical levels together (main menu, submenu)
  - Respect information architecture relationships
  - Verify menu fit and alignment after replacement
  
  ## Best Practices
  - **Preserve Design Intent**: Always prioritize design integrity
  - **Structural Consistency**: Maintain alignment, spacing, and hierarchy
  - **Visual Feedback**: Verify each chunk visually before proceeding
  - **Incremental Improvement**: Learn from each chunk to improve subsequent ones
  - **Balance Automation & Control**: Let AI handle repetitive replacements but maintain oversight
  - **Respect Content Relationships**: Keep related content consistent across chunks
  
  Remember that text is never just text—it's a core design element that must work harmoniously with the overall composition. This chunk-based strategy allows you to methodically transform text while maintaining design integrity.`,

    (extra) => {
      return {
        messages: [
          {
            role: "assistant",
            content: {
              type: "text",
              text: `# Automatic Annotation Conversion
              
  ## Process Overview
  
  The process of converting manual annotations (numbered/alphabetical indicators with connected descriptions) to Figma's native annotations:
  
  1. Get selected frame/component information
  2. Scan and collect all annotation text nodes
  3. Scan target UI elements (components, instances, frames)
  4. Match annotations to appropriate UI elements
  5. Apply native Figma annotations
  
  ## Step 1: Get Selection and Initial Setup
  
  First, get the selected frame or component that contains annotations:
  
  \`\`\`typescript
  // Get the selected frame/component
  const selection = await get_selection();
  const selectedNodeId = selection[0].id
  
  // Get available annotation categories for later use
  const annotationData = await get_annotations({
    nodeId: selectedNodeId,
    includeCategories: true
  });
  const categories = annotationData.categories;
  \`\`\`
  
  ## Step 2: Scan Annotation Text Nodes
  
  Scan all text nodes to identify annotations and their descriptions:
  
  \`\`\`typescript
  // Get all text nodes in the selection
  const textNodes = await scan_text_nodes({
    nodeId: selectedNodeId
  });
  
  // Filter and group annotation markers and descriptions
  
  // Markers typically have these characteristics:
  // - Short text content (usually single digit/letter)
  // - Specific font styles (often bold)
  // - Located in a container with "Marker" or "Dot" in the name
  // - Have a clear naming pattern (e.g., "1", "2", "3" or "A", "B", "C")
  
  
  // Identify description nodes
  // Usually longer text nodes near markers or with matching numbers in path
    
  \`\`\`
  
  ## Step 3: Scan Target UI Elements
  
  Get all potential target elements that annotations might refer to:
  
  \`\`\`typescript
  // Scan for all UI elements that could be annotation targets
  const targetNodes = await scan_nodes_by_types({
    nodeId: selectedNodeId,
    types: [
      "COMPONENT",
      "INSTANCE",
      "FRAME"
    ]
  });
  \`\`\`
  
  ## Step 4: Match Annotations to Targets
  
  Match each annotation to its target UI element using these strategies in order of priority:
  
  1. **Path-Based Matching**:
     - Look at the marker's parent container name in the Figma layer hierarchy
     - Remove any "Marker:" or "Annotation:" prefixes from the parent name
     - Find UI elements that share the same parent name or have it in their path
     - This works well when markers are grouped with their target elements
  
  2. **Name-Based Matching**:
     - Extract key terms from the annotation description
     - Look for UI elements whose names contain these key terms
     - Consider both exact matches and semantic similarities
     - Particularly effective for form fields, buttons, and labeled components
  
  3. **Proximity-Based Matching** (fallback):
     - Calculate the center point of the marker
     - Find the closest UI element by measuring distances to element centers
     - Consider the marker's position relative to nearby elements
     - Use this method when other matching strategies fail
  
  Additional Matching Considerations:
  - Give higher priority to matches found through path-based matching
  - Consider the type of UI element when evaluating matches
  - Take into account the annotation's context and content
  - Use a combination of strategies for more accurate matching
  
  ## Step 5: Apply Native Annotations
  
  Convert matched annotations to Figma's native annotations using batch processing:
  
  \`\`\`typescript
  // Prepare annotations array for batch processing
  const annotationsToApply = Object.values(annotations).map(({ marker, description }) => {
    // Find target using multiple strategies
    const target = 
      findTargetByPath(marker, targetNodes) ||
      findTargetByName(description, targetNodes) ||
      findTargetByProximity(marker, targetNodes);
    
    if (target) {
      // Determine appropriate category based on content
      const category = determineCategory(description.characters, categories);
  
      // Determine appropriate additional annotationProperty based on content
      const annotationProperty = determineProperties(description.characters, target.type);
      
      return {
        nodeId: target.id,
        labelMarkdown: description.characters,
        categoryId: category.id,
        properties: annotationProperty
      };
    }
    return null;
  }).filter(Boolean); // Remove null entries
  
  // Apply annotations in batches using set_multiple_annotations
  if (annotationsToApply.length > 0) {
    await set_multiple_annotations({
      nodeId: selectedNodeId,
      annotations: annotationsToApply
    });
  }
  \`\`\`
  
  
  This strategy focuses on practical implementation based on real-world usage patterns, emphasizing the importance of handling various UI elements as annotation targets, not just text nodes.`

          },

              text: `# Swap Component Instance and Override Strategy
  
  ## Overview
  This strategy enables transferring content and property overrides from a source instance to one or more target instances in Figma, maintaining design consistency while reducing manual work.
  
  ## Step-by-Step Process
  
  ### 1. Selection Analysis
  - Use \`get_selection()\` to identify the parent component or selected instances
  - For parent components, scan for instances with \`scan_nodes_by_types({ nodeId: "parent-id", types: ["INSTANCE"] })\`
  - Identify custom slots by name patterns (e.g. "Custom Slot*" or "Instance Slot") or by examining text content
  - Determine which is the source instance (with content to copy) and which are targets (where to apply content)
  
  ### 2. Extract Source Overrides
  - Use \`get_instance_overrides()\` to extract customizations from the source instance
  - This captures text content, property values, and style overrides
  - Command syntax: \`get_instance_overrides({ nodeId: "source-instance-id" })\`
  - Look for successful response like "Got component information from [instance name]"
  
  ### 3. Apply Overrides to Targets
  - Apply captured overrides using \`set_instance_overrides()\`
  - Command syntax:
    \`\`\`
    set_instance_overrides({
      sourceInstanceId: "source-instance-id", 
      targetNodeIds: ["target-id-1", "target-id-2", ...]
    })
    \`\`\`
  
  ### 4. Verification
  - Verify results with \`get_node_info()\` or \`read_my_design()\`
  - Confirm text content and style overrides have transferred successfully
  
  ## Key Tips
  - Always join the appropriate channel first with \`join_channel()\`
  - When working with multiple targets, check the full selection with \`get_selection()\`
  - Preserve component relationships by using instance overrides rather than direct text manipulation`,

function registerReactionToConnectorStrategy(server: McpServer) {
  server.prompt(
    "reaction_to_connector_strategy",
    "Strategy for converting Figma prototype reactions to connector lines using the output of 'get_reactions'",
    (extra) => {
      return {
        messages: [
          {
            role: "assistant",
            content: {
              type: "text",
              text: `# Strategy: Convert Figma Prototype Reactions to Connector Lines
  
  ## Goal
  Process the JSON output from the \`get_reactions\` tool to generate an array of connection objects suitable for the \`create_connections\` tool. This visually represents prototype flows as connector lines on the Figma canvas.
  
  ## Input Data
  You will receive JSON data from the \`get_reactions\` tool. This data contains an array of nodes, each with potential reactions. A typical reaction object looks like this:
  \`\`\`json
  {
    "trigger": { "type": "ON_CLICK" },
    "action": {
      "type": "NAVIGATE",
      "destinationId": "destination-node-id",
      "navigationTransition": { ... },
      "preserveScrollPosition": false
    }
  }
  \`\`\`
  
  ## Step-by-Step Process
  
  ### 1. Preparation & Context Gathering
     - **Action:** Call \`read_my_design\` on the relevant node(s) to get context about the nodes involved (names, types, etc.). This helps in generating meaningful connector labels later.
     - **Action:** Call \`set_default_connector\` **without** the \`connectorId\` parameter.
     - **Check Result:** Analyze the response from \`set_default_connector\`.
       - If it confirms a default connector is already set (e.g., "Default connector is already set"), proceed to Step 2.
       - If it indicates no default connector is set (e.g., "No default connector set..."), you **cannot** proceed with \`create_connections\` yet. Inform the user they need to manually copy a connector from FigJam, paste it onto the current page, select it, and then you can run \`set_default_connector({ connectorId: "SELECTED_NODE_ID" })\` before attempting \`create_connections\`. **Do not proceed to Step 2 until a default connector is confirmed.**
  
  ### 2. Filter and Transform Reactions from \`get_reactions\` Output
     - **Iterate:** Go through the JSON array provided by \`get_reactions\`. For each node in the array:
       - Iterate through its \`reactions\` array.
     - **Filter:** Keep only reactions where the \`action\` meets these criteria:
       - Has a \`type\` that implies a connection (e.g., \`NAVIGATE\`, \`OPEN_OVERLAY\`, \`SWAP_OVERLAY\`). **Ignore** types like \`CHANGE_TO\`, \`CLOSE_OVERLAY\`, etc.
       - Has a valid \`destinationId\` property.
     - **Extract:** For each valid reaction, extract the following information:
       - \`sourceNodeId\`: The ID of the node the reaction belongs to (from the outer loop).
       - \`destinationNodeId\`: The value of \`action.destinationId\`.
       - \`actionType\`: The value of \`action.type\`.
       - \`triggerType\`: The value of \`trigger.type\`.
  
  ### 3. Generate Connector Text Labels
     - **For each extracted connection:** Create a concise, descriptive text label string.
     - **Combine Information:** Use the \`actionType\`, \`triggerType\`, and potentially the names of the source/destination nodes (obtained from Step 1's \`read_my_design\` or by calling \`get_node_info\` if necessary) to generate the label.
     - **Example Labels:**
       - If \`triggerType\` is "ON\_CLICK" and \`actionType\` is "NAVIGATE": "On click, navigate to [Destination Node Name]"
       - If \`triggerType\` is "ON\_DRAG" and \`actionType\` is "OPEN\_OVERLAY": "On drag, open [Destination Node Name] overlay"
     - **Keep it brief and informative.** Let this generated string be \`generatedText\`.
  
  ### 4. Prepare the \`connections\` Array for \`create_connections\`
     - **Structure:** Create a JSON array where each element is an object representing a connection.
     - **Format:** Each object in the array must have the following structure:
       \`\`\`json
       {
         "startNodeId": "sourceNodeId_from_step_2",
         "endNodeId": "destinationNodeId_from_step_2",
         "text": "generatedText_from_step_3"
       }
       \`\`\`
     - **Result:** This final array is the value you will pass to the \`connections\` parameter when calling the \`create_connections\` tool.
  
  ### 5. Execute Connection Creation
     - **Action:** Call the \`create_connections\` tool, passing the array generated in Step 4 as the \`connections\` argument.
     - **Verify:** Check the response from \`create_connections\` to confirm success or failure.
  
  This detailed process ensures you correctly interpret the reaction data, prepare the necessary information, and use the appropriate tools to create the connector lines.`
