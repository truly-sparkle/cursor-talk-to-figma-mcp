# Talk to Figma MCP

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration between AI agent (Cursor, Claude Code) and Figma, allowing AI agent to communicate with Figma for reading designs and modifying them programmatically.

## Project Structure

- `src/talk_to_figma_mcp/` - TypeScript MCP server for Figma integration
- `src/cursor_mcp_plugin/` - Figma plugin for communicating with Cursor
- `src/socket.ts` - WebSocket server that facilitates communication between the MCP server and Figma plugin

## How to use

1. Install Bun if you haven't already:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

2. Run setup, this will also install MCP in your Cursor's active project

```bash
bun setup
```

3. Start the Websocket server

```bash
bun socket
```

4. **NEW** Install Figma plugin from [Figma community page](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1485687494525374295/cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp-plugin) or [install locally](#figma-plugin)

## Design Automation Example

**Bulk text content replacement**

Thanks to [@dusskapark](https://github.com/dusskapark) for contributing the bulk text replacement feature. Here is the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j05gGT3xfCs).

**Instance Override Propagation**
Another contribution from [@dusskapark](https://github.com/dusskapark)
Propagate component instance overrides from a source instance to multiple target instances with a single command. This feature dramatically reduces repetitive design work when working with component instances that need similar customizations. Check out our [demo video](https://youtu.be/uvuT8LByroI).

## Manual Setup and Installation

### MCP Server: Integration with Cursor

Add the server to your Cursor MCP configuration in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "TalkToFigma": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### WebSocket Server

Start the WebSocket server:

```bash
bun socket
```

### Figma Plugin

1. In Figma, go to Plugins > Development > New Plugin
2. Choose "Link existing plugin"
3. Select the `src/cursor_mcp_plugin/manifest.json` file
4. The plugin should now be available in your Figma development plugins

## Windows + WSL Guide

1. Install bun via powershell

```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

2. Uncomment the hostname `0.0.0.0` in `src/socket.ts`

```typescript
// uncomment this to allow connections in windows wsl
hostname: "0.0.0.0",
```

3. Start the websocket

```bash
bun socket
```

## Usage

1. Start the WebSocket server
2. Install the MCP server in Cursor
3. Open Figma and run the Cursor MCP Plugin
4. Connect the plugin to the WebSocket server by joining a channel using `join_channel`
5. Use Cursor to communicate with Figma using the MCP tools

### Changing the relay port

The default port is `3055`. If you change it, **three places must agree**:

1. `bun socket` — set `PORT` env (`PORT=4000 bun socket`).
2. The MCP server — pass `--port=4000` (it reuses the port for the WS URL).
3. **`src/cursor_mcp_plugin/manifest.json`** — `networkAccess.allowedDomains`
   has a hard-coded `ws://localhost:3055` (and the same in
   `devAllowedDomains`). Edit both to match the new port, then re-import the
   plugin in Figma. The Figma plugin manifest can't read env at load time,
   so this entry must be edited per environment.

## Security Model

This project is designed for **local-only** use. Defaults assume the
relay, the MCP server, and Figma are all running on the same machine.

**What we protect against:**
- Channel name validation (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`) — prevents arbitrary
  channel-stuffing and log noise.
- Message-format validation in the relay — bad JSON or wrong types reply
  with `{type:"error"}` instead of being silently dropped.
- Optional shared-secret token (`FIGMA_RELAY_TOKEN`) for the relay — see
  next section. Constant-time comparison to avoid timing leaks.

**What we do NOT protect against by default:**
- **Local processes on the same machine** can connect to the relay and
  join any channel. If you don't trust other code on your machine, set
  `FIGMA_RELAY_TOKEN`.
- **Network-exposed relays** (binding to `0.0.0.0`, port-forwarding, WSL
  bridges) are not protected unless you set `FIGMA_RELAY_TOKEN`. Without
  the token, anyone who can reach the port can drive your Figma plugin.
- **TLS** — the relay speaks plain `ws://`, not `wss://`. Suitable for
  loopback only. For remote use, terminate TLS at a reverse proxy.
- **No file content scrubbing** — what the MCP tools read out of Figma
  (node trees, text, fills, etc.) is sent to the LLM client as-is.
  Don't run this against design files containing secrets you wouldn't
  show the model.

If you're going to expose the relay beyond `localhost`, set the token
**before** binding to a public interface.

## Optional: Relay Authentication

By default the WebSocket relay (`bun socket`) accepts joins from anyone on
the host. For non-localhost setups (e.g. WSL bridging, remote relay), set a
shared secret on the relay process and have both the MCP server and the
Figma plugin send it on join:

```bash
# Same value in all three places.
export FIGMA_RELAY_TOKEN="some-long-random-string"

bun socket   # relay reads it from env and rejects joins without a match
```

For the MCP server, set the same env var in your `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "TalkToFigma": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp@latest"],
      "env": { "FIGMA_RELAY_TOKEN": "some-long-random-string" }
    }
  }
}
```

For the plugin, paste the same token into the **Relay Token** field on the
Connection tab. It's stored in the plugin's `localStorage` so you only enter
it once per machine.

When `FIGMA_RELAY_TOKEN` is unset on the relay, all three sides skip the
check (backward compatible).

## Local Development Setup

To develop, update your mcp config to direct to your local directory.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "TalkToFigma": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["/path-to-repo/src/talk_to_figma_mcp/server.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP Prompts

The MCP server includes several helper prompts to guide you through complex design tasks:

- `reaction_to_connector_strategy` - Strategy for converting Figma prototype reactions to connector lines using the output of 'get_reactions', and guiding the use 'create_connections' in sequence

## Development

### Building the Figma Plugin

1. Navigate to the Figma plugin directory:

   ```
   cd src/cursor_mcp_plugin
   ```

2. Edit code.js and ui.html

## Best Practices

When working with the Figma MCP:

1. Always join a channel before sending commands
2. Get document overview using `get_document_info` first
3. Check current selection with `get_selection` before modifications
4. Use appropriate creation tools based on needs:
   - `create_frame` for containers
   - `create_rectangle` for basic shapes
   - `create_text` for text elements
5. Verify changes using `get_node_info`
6. Use component instances when possible for consistency
7. Handle errors appropriately as all commands can throw exceptions
8. For large designs:
   - Use chunking parameters in `scan_text_nodes`
   - Monitor progress through WebSocket updates
   - Implement appropriate error handling
9. For text operations:
   - Use batch operations when possible
   - Consider structural relationships
   - Verify changes with targeted exports
10. For converting legacy annotations:
    - Scan text nodes to identify numbered markers and descriptions
    - Use `scan_nodes_by_types` to find UI elements that annotations refer to
    - Match markers with their target elements using path, name, or proximity
    - Categorize annotations appropriately with `get_annotations`
    - Create native annotations with `set_multiple_annotations` in batches
    - Verify all annotations are properly linked to their targets
    - Delete legacy annotation nodes after successful conversion
11. Visualize prototype noodles as FigJam connectors:

- Use `get_reactions` to extract prototype flows,
- set a default connector with `set_default_connector`,
- and generate connector lines with `create_connections` for clear visual flow mapping.
